      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-what-is-calculus&#34;&gt;1. What Is Calculus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculus is a fundamental branch of mathematics that provides a rigorous language for describing change and accumulation. It allows us to analyze how quantities vary continuously and how infinitely small changes combine to produce finite results. At its core, calculus is concerned with understanding processes that evolve smoothly rather than in discrete steps, such as motion, growth, heat flow, or variation in physical systems.&lt;br&gt;
 The field is often divided into two sections called differential calculus and integral calculus. In this section, we will be focusing on differential calculus, which is often called in most universities&amp;rsquo; curricula, Calculus I.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
