&lt;p&gt;There is a common saying that &lt;span style=&#34;color: red;&#34;&gt;physics is applied mathematics&lt;/span&gt;, chemistry is applied physics, and biology is applied chemistry. In the context of this course, we find ourselves in a position where the close relationship between mathematics and physics becomes particularly apparent. Many of the ideas developed in advanced calculus emphasize how deeply physical reasoning is intertwined with mathematical structure.&lt;br&gt;
 This observation should not be interpreted as a claim that mathematics is superior to physics, or vice versa. Rather, it highlights the mutual dependence between the two disciplines. Mathematics provides a precise language and framework, while physics offers concrete motivation and interpretation. Neither can meaningfully advance without the other.&lt;br&gt;
 This perspective became especially clear when I first began studying advanced calculus. A large portion of its core concepts—particularly those belonging to vector calculus—originate from physical problems. The development of notions such as flux, circulation, and divergence was driven by the need to describe physical phenomena like fluid flow, electromagnetic fields, and conservation laws. Many of the theorems encountered in this subject are not abstract constructions, but formal expressions of physical principles.&lt;br&gt;
 During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, mathematicians such as Euler, Lagrange, Gauss, and Green developed the foundations of multivariable calculus while studying mechanics, gravitation, and electromagnetism. Their work revealed that integration over curves, surfaces, and volumes is not merely a technical extension of single-variable calculus, but a necessary language for expressing fundamental laws of nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
