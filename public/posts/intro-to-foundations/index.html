Direct proofs, proof by contradiction, contrapositive arguments.\nSome Historical Background Aristotle (384–322 BCE) is widely regarded as the founder of formal logic. While earlier philosophers had reflected on reasoning and argumentation, Aristotle was the first to develop a systematic theory that analyzed the structure of valid arguments independently of their specific content. His work on logic laid the groundwork for deductive reasoning and shaped mathematical and philosophical thought for over two millennia.\n1. Aristotle’s Laws of Logic Classical logic is traditionally grounded in three fundamental principles attributed to Aristotle. These laws form the basis of rational thought and are implicitly assumed in mathematical reasoning, philosophical argumentation, and formal proof techniques.\n1.1 Law of Identity Statement: A thing is identical to itself.\n“A is A.”\nThe Law of Identity asserts that every object, concept, or proposition remains the same as itself. This principle ensures consistency in meaning and allows definitions to be fixed throughout a logical or mathematical discussion. Without this law, precise reasoning would be impossible, since symbols and statements could not retain stable interpretations.\n1.2 Law of Non-Contradiction Statement: A proposition cannot be both true and false at the same time and in the same respect.\n“It is impossible for the same thing to belong and not belong to the same thing at\nthe same time and in the same respect.”\nThis law is considered by Aristotle to be the most fundamental principle of logic. Historically, this law also played a central role in metaphysical and theological discussions, as it was used to rule out the possibility of mutually contradictory attributes.\n1.3 Law of Excluded Middle Statement: Every proposition is either true or false.\n“Either A is true, or its negation is true.”\nThe Law of Excluded Middle asserts that there is no third option between truth and falsity. Every meaningful statement must fall into one of these two categories.\nPDF\r",
