Higher-Dimensional Calculus In elementary calculus, much of our intuition is built on functions defined along a single direction. We integrate with respect to $x$ or $y$, and the differential element $dx$ represents a small displacement along a straight line. Geometrically, this corresponds to working on objects that are essentially one-dimensional. Even when we study areas under curves, the underlying motion of integration remains linear: we move point by point along an axis, accumulating contributions in a fixed direction.\nHowever, many mathematical and physical phenomena are not confined to such simple settings. Quantities such as mass density, electric charge, temperature, or fluid flow are distributed over regions of space rather than along a line. To describe and analyze these situations, calculus must be extended beyond the number line and even beyond the plane. This transition marks the beginning of what is commonly referred to as advanced calculus.\nA first step in this extension is the introduction of double and triple integrals. Instead of integrating along a single direction, we integrate over regions in the plane or volumes in space. The differential elements $dx,dy$ and $dx,dy,dz$ no longer represent motion along a line, but rather infinitesimal pieces of area and volume. As a result, integration acquires a genuinely geometric character: double integrals naturally measure area-weighted quantities, while triple integrals capture volumetric accumulation. The increase in dimension fundamentally changes both the interpretation and the techniques of integration.\n",
