The conditions, however, are considerable. Notice that, firstly, we need a nonempty set. The reason is trivial to comprehend, as the empty set has no elements and therefore it cannot have a least element. Furthermore, the set must be a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$.\nWe can consider some sets and determine whether they satisfy the Well Ordering Principle, i.e., they are well ordered. Example: Consider the set\n$$ S=\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid x\u003e4\\}. $$\nHere, from the set notation, we conclude that $S$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$. Also, we can show that the set is nonempty, as $10 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $10\u003e4$ and therefore $10 \\in S$. Hence, the set $S$ satisfies the conditions of Well Ordering Principle and therefore $S$ is well ordered.\nMoreover, the least element of $S$ is 5. Since $5 \\in S$ and for all $x \\in S$, $x \\geq 5$.\nExample: Consider the set\n$$ \\{\\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1,2,3,\\dots\\}. $$\nWe can easily see that, letting $S=\\{\\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1,2,3,\\dots\\}$, $S$ is not a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$. We can show this by the fact that $-3 \\in S$ and $-3 \\notin \\mathbb{N}$ and therefore there exists some $x \\in S$ such that $x \\notin \\mathbb{N}$, which implies that $S$ is not a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$, by definition of subsets.\nHowever, we cannot deduce that $S$ is not well ordered just because $S$ does not satisfy a condition of Well Ordering Principle. This is a common mistake in mathematical reasoning. Well Ordering Principle says that if a set satisfies some conditions, then it is guaranteed that it has a least element and thus it is a well ordered set, but it does not assert that if a set does not satisfy at least one condition, then it cannot be well ordered.\nHere, the reader may say “But $\\{\\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1,2,3,\\dots\\}$ does not seem well ordered to me.” and one could be right. In fact, $\\{\\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1,2,3,\\dots\\}$ is not well ordered. Then how can we prove it?\nWell Ordering Proofs:\nWell Ordering proofs mainly consist of two types of proofs. In the first one, we show that a set is well ordered by showing the corresponding set satisfies the conditions of Well Ordering Principle. In the latter one, we show that the set is not well ordered by a contradiction, i.e., we first assume that the set is well ordered, and then obtain a contradiction from such an assumption.\nExample: Show that\n$$ S=\\{\\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1,2,3,\\dots\\} $$\nis not well ordered.\nSolution:\nAssume towards a contradiction that $S$ is a well ordered set. Then $S$ has a least element. Let $x$ be the least element of $S$. Then, we get $x \\in S$ and for all $a \\in S$, $a \\geq x$.\nHere, it is clear that $S=\\mathbb{Z}$ and since $x \\in S$, $x-1 \\in S$, as both $x$ and $x-1$ are integers. But then, $x-1 \u003c x$, which is a contradiction to the fact that “for all $a \\in S$, $a \\geq x$”. Therefore, by proof by contradiction, $S$ is not well ordered.\nDefinition. Theorem is a statement which is true and can be proven.\nTheorem. If $a,b \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then there exists $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $na \\geq b$.\nThis theorem is also called the Archimedean Property of Integers.\nProof. Suppose towards a contradiction that the theorem is false and therefore there exist some natural numbers $a,b$ such that $na \u003c b$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nLet $S$ be the set given by\n$$ S=\\{b-na \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}, b-na\u003e0\\}. $$\nObserve that $S$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$, since $b,n,a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and so $b-na \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (and since it is $\u003e0$, it is in $\\mathbb{N}$). Furthermore, assuming that $n=1 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $b\u003ea$ and so $b-a\u003e0$, we have $b-a \\in S$. Therefore, $S$ is nonempty. Hence, according to Well Ordering Principle, $S$ has a least element.\nLet $x$ be the least element of $S$. Hence, by definition of $S$, $x=b-\\tilde{n}a$ for some arbitrary $\\tilde{n} \\in \\mathbb{N}$. But then, $b-(\\tilde{n}+1)a$ is also an element of $S$. It follows that $b-(\\tilde{n}+1)a \u003c b-\\tilde{n}a$, which contradicts the fact that $b-\\tilde{n}a$ is the least element of $S$.\nPDF\r",

<p>is not well ordered.</p>
<p> <span style="color: orange">Solution:</span><br>
 Assume towards a contradiction that $S$ is a well ordered set. Then $S$ has a least element. Let $x$ be the least element of $S$. Then, we get $x \in S$ and for all $a \in S$, $a \geq x$.</p>
<p>Here, it is clear that $S=\mathbb{Z}$ and since $x \in S$, $x-1 \in S$, as both $x$ and $x-1$ are integers. But then, $x-1 &lt; x$, which is a contradiction to the fact that &ldquo;for all $a \in S$, $a \geq x$&rdquo;. Therefore, by proof by contradiction, $S$ is not well ordered.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Theorem is a statement which is true and can be proven.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> If $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$, then there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $na \geq b$.</p>
<p>This theorem is also called the Archimedean Property of Integers.</p>
<p><strong>Proof.</strong>
Suppose towards a contradiction that the theorem is false and therefore there exist some natural numbers $a,b$ such that $na &lt; b$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.<br>
 Let $S$ be the set given by</p>
<p>$$
S=\{b-na \mid n \in \mathbb{N}, b-na&gt;0\}.
$$</p>
<p>Observe that $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, since $b,n,a \in \mathbb{N}$ and so $b-na \in \mathbb{Z}$ (and since it is $&gt;0$, it is in $\mathbb{N}$). Furthermore, assuming that $n=1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and $b&gt;a$ and so $b-a&gt;0$, we have $b-a \in S$. Therefore, $S$ is nonempty. Hence, according to Well Ordering Principle, $S$ has a least element.</p>
<p>Let $x$ be the least element of $S$. Hence, by definition of $S$, $x=b-\tilde{n}a$ for some arbitrary $\tilde{n} \in \mathbb{N}$. But then, $b-(\tilde{n}+1)a$ is also an element of $S$. It follows that $b-(\tilde{n}+1)a &lt; b-\tilde{n}a$, which contradicts the fact that $b-\tilde{n}a$ is the least element of $S$.</p>
