<h3 style="text-align: center;">Preliminaries</h3>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Elementary facts:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>There is &ldquo;addition on $\mathbb{Z}$&rdquo;, denoted by &ldquo;$+$&rdquo; such that for any $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $a+b$ is uniquely determined.</li>
<li>For any $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$, $(a+b) + c=a + (b+c)$.</li>
<li>There exists an integer, namely $0$, such that $a+0=a=0+a$ for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}$.</li>
<li>For any $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $a+b=b+a$.</li>
<li>There is &ldquo;multiplication on $\mathbb{Z}$&rdquo;, denoted by &ldquo;$\cdot$&rdquo; such that for any $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $a \cdot b$ is uniquely determined.</li>
<li>For any $a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}$,
$$
a\cdot(b+c)=ab+ac \quad \text{and} \quad (a+b)\cdot c=ac+bc.
$$</li>
<li>$1 \cdot a = a = a \cdot 1$.</li>
<li>For any $a, b \in \mathbb{Z} $, $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$.</li>
<li>For any $a, b , c \in \mathbb{Z} $, $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot(b \cdot c)$.</li>
<li>For all $a \in \mathbb{Z}, a \cdot 0= 0 \cdot a = 0$.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Remark.</strong>
The definition of standard number sets may vary depending on the context. For instance, in some areas of mathematics, the set of natural numbers is defined as</p>
<p>$$
\mathbb{N} = {0,1,2,3,\dots},
$$</p>
<p>whereas in number theory it is common to define</p>
<p>$$
\mathbb{N} = {1,2,3,4,\dots} = \mathbb{Z}^+.
$$</p>
<p>Throughout these notes, we adopt the latter convention, that is, $\mathbb{N}$ denotes the set of positive integers.</p>
<p><strong>Remark.</strong>
For any $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, one and only one of the following holds:</p>
<p>(i) $a \in \mathbb{Z}^+$</p>
<p>(ii) $a=0$</p>
<p>(iii) $a \in \mathbb{Z}^-$.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> <span style="color: red">Axiom</span> is a statement assumed to be true without any proof.<br>
