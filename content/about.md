I am Selim Kaan Özsoy from Turkey. I have been studying at Middle East Technical University (METU) since 2023. After completing two years as a Mechanical Engineering major, I started a double major in Mathematics in 2025, and I plan to begin a minor in Physics in the Spring of 2026.

I have been interested in teaching and writing since high school. When I began studying mathematics and became familiar with mathematical writing, I realized how naturally clear exposition and scientific thinking come together in this field. As I explored the structure and style of mathematical texts, I gradually developed a strong interest in writing my own lecture notes.

This interest grew further when I started learning \LaTeX, which allowed me to express mathematical ideas in a clear and structured way. Around the same time, a close friend from Ankara University, whose GitHub profile can be found on the Home page, told me that he was working on frontend and backend web development. We decided to combine our interests and build a website where I could share the notes I was writing.

The main purpose of this project is to share student-friendly lecture notes written in an academic but accessible style. While preparing these notes, I try to keep in mind the difficulties I personally encountered during my university education and to present the material in a way that is clear, honest, and freely available to everyone.
